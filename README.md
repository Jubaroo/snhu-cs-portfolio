# Jarrod Schantz - Computer Science Portfolio

## About Me
I am a computer science student at Southern New Hampshire University, developing skills in software development, data structures, and algorithm design. I am passionate about creating efficient, well-documented software solutions.

## About This Portfolio
This repository showcases my work and projects from the SNHU Computer Science program. It demonstrates my understanding of programming concepts, problem-solving abilities, and software development practices.

## Projects

### CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms - Analysis and Design

#### ABCU Course Planner
A command-line course management system for the ABCU Computer Science Department that efficiently organizes and retrieves course information.

- **Description**: Implements a Binary Search Tree data structure to manage course information, including course numbers, titles, and prerequisites. Features include loading course data from files, displaying sorted course lists, searching for specific courses, and validating prerequisite relationships.
- **Technologies**: C++
- **Skills Demonstrated**: 
  - Binary Search Tree implementation and traversal
  - File I/O and data parsing
  - Data validation and error handling
  - Memory management
  - Algorithm efficiency (O(log n) search time)
  - Code documentation and organization

**Key Features:**
- Efficient course insertion and retrieval using BST
- In-order traversal for alphabetically sorted course display
- Two-pass validation system for data integrity
- Prerequisite verification
- Case-insensitive course search
- Menu-driven user interface

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**: C++
- **Concepts**: Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis and Design, Object-Oriented Programming
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub
- **Data Structures**: Binary Search Trees, Vectors, Linked Structures
- **Practices**: Code documentation, error handling, memory management

## Education
**Southern New Hampshire University**
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
- Currently Enrolled
