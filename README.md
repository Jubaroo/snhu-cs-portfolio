# Jarrod Schantz - Computer Science Portfolio

## About Me
I am a computer science student at Southern New Hampshire University, developing skills in software development, data structures, algorithm design, and software architecture. I am passionate about creating efficient, well-documented software solutions and applying software engineering principles to real-world problems.

## About This Portfolio
This repository showcases my work and projects from the SNHU Computer Science program. It demonstrates my understanding of programming concepts, problem-solving abilities, software development practices, system design, and cross-platform development considerations.

## Projects

### CS-210: Programming Languages

#### Grocery Tracker
[View Project Repository](https://github.com/Jubaroo/GroceryTracker)

A C++ application that tracks and analyzes grocery item purchase frequencies with data visualization and backup capabilities.

- **Description**: Reads grocery item data from an input file, tracks purchase frequencies using a map data structure, and provides multiple viewing options including standard frequency lists and visual histograms. The application includes automatic data backup and case-insensitive search functionality.
- **Technologies**: C++
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Map data structure implementation
  - File I/O operations (reading and writing)
  - Object-oriented design with header and implementation files
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Data visualization (histogram generation)
  - Case-insensitive string processing
  - Modular code organization
  - Doxygen documentation standards

**Key Features:**
- Real-time frequency tracking using STL map container
- Case-insensitive item search
- Multiple output formats (list and histogram)
- Automatic backup file generation
- Robust input validation
- Clean separation of interface and implementation
- Menu-driven user interface

### CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms - Analysis and Design

#### ABCU Course Planner
[View Project Repository](https://github.com/Jubaroo/ABCU-Course-Planner)

A command-line course management system for the ABCU Computer Science Department that efficiently organizes and retrieves course information.

- **Description**: Implements a Binary Search Tree data structure to manage course information, including course numbers, titles, and prerequisites. Features include loading course data from files, displaying sorted course lists, searching for specific courses, and validating prerequisite relationships.
- **Technologies**: C++
- **Skills Demonstrated**: 
  - Binary Search Tree implementation and traversal
  - File I/O and data parsing
  - Data validation and error handling
  - Memory management
  - Algorithm efficiency (O(log n) search time)
  - Code documentation and organization

**Key Features:**
- Efficient course insertion and retrieval using BST
- In-order traversal for alphabetically sorted course display
- Two-pass validation system for data integrity
- Prerequisite verification
- Case-insensitive course search
- Menu-driven user interface

### CS-230: Operating Platforms

#### The Gaming Room - Software Design Document
[View Project Repository](https://github.com/Jubaroo/The-Gaming-Room)

A comprehensive software design document for expanding "Draw It or Lose It" from a single-platform Android game to a multi-platform web-based application.

- **Description**: Complete software design documentation detailing the architecture, platform evaluation, and technical recommendations for transforming a mobile game into a scalable, distributed web application accessible across multiple operating systems and devices.
- **Technologies**: Java, Dropwizard framework, RESTful APIs, UML
- **Skills Demonstrated**: 
  - Software architecture and system design
  - Cross-platform development analysis
  - UML domain modeling with inheritance
  - Design pattern implementation (Singleton, Iterator)
  - Platform evaluation (Linux, macOS, Windows, Mobile)
  - Security architecture and requirements
  - Distributed systems design
  - Technical writing and documentation

**Key Components:**
- **Domain Model**: UML class diagram implementing object-oriented principles with Entity base class and Game, Team, and Player inheritance hierarchy
- **Design Patterns**: 
  - Singleton pattern for GameService to ensure single active game instance
  - Iterator pattern for efficient traversal of games, teams, and players
- **Platform Recommendations**:
  - Linux server-side hosting for cost-effectiveness and scalability
  - Cross-platform frameworks (React Native/Flutter) for client-side development
  - Cloud-based storage solutions (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- **Security Features**: HTTPS, OAuth authentication, TLS/SSL encryption, role-based access control
- **Architecture**: RESTful APIs with WebSocket support for real-time gameplay, load balancing, and distributed networking

**Design Constraints Addressed:**
- Platform compatibility across Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices
- Unique identifier management for games, teams, and players
- Real-time performance with minimal latency
- Robust security and data protection
- Scalability for concurrent users and games
